# redditr
redditr is an R package intended to help obtain content from Reddit by interfacing with the <a href = "https://github.com/pushshift/api"> pushshift.io Reddit API</a>.

The immediate scope of this package is to build functionality for getting Reddit data into R. Longer term, I'm also hoping to add functionality for prepping data for analysis/visualization. Let's see how this goes...

## Installation
Install via devtools:
``` r
devtools::install_github("geoffwlamb/redditr")
```
## Functionality under construction. Please check back later.
